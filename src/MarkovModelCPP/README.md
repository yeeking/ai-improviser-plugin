# MarkovModelCPP

Implementation of a markov model in C++. 

Useful for musical applications and such, in case you don't like 
neural networks :) 

Check out the MarkovTests.cpp file:

```
g++ MarkovTest.cpp  MarkovChain.cpp MarkovManager.cpp -o markovtest
./markovtest
```

You can interact with the markovmanager for a simple high level interface, 
or with the markovchain directly.
